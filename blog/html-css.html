    <h1>Relative, Absolute and Fixed positioning in CSS</h1>
    <h2>What are they and how do they <em>differ?</em></h2>

    <p>
      Every element on a web page is a block or a rectangle of pixels. Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are some of the tools you can use in CSS to move these blocks exactly where you want them to go (instead of having one big list of elements like the below).

    <p>
        This initial positioning is called "static" and is the default for every element.
    </p>
    Relative Positioning
    <p>
      Relative positioning is a way to move your blocks (or elements) in context to themselves. IE the movement commands you use in conjunction with relative positioning will operate relative to where the block would normally be.

    <p>
      In this example the box would move down 600 px or pixels.
When using relative positioning the moved block is not removed from the documents flow - ie. box 2 and 3 will still act as though box 1 is in its original position.
    </p>

    Absolute Positioning
    <p>
      Absolute positioning is a way to move blocks in context to the closest containing element that has been assigned a position (eg. relative). The containing element is referred to as the 'parent' element.
    </p>  
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In this example the box would move 600 px or pixels down from the the top edge of the <em>parent</em>.
      This means that if the box was already positioned 700 pixels below the parents top edge it would actually move up <em>up</em> 100 pixels from its current position.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this function to make the box move outside of the parent by specifying a negative (-##px).
      You can also make the box flush with the parent by using 0px as the distance - the below would have the box flush with the parens <em>left</em> wall.
    </p>

When using the absolute positioning function elements <em>are</em> removed from the documents flow
