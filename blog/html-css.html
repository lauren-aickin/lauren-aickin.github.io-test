    <h1>Relative, Absolute and Fixed positioning in CSS</h1>
    <h2>What are they and how do they <em>differ?</em></h2>

    <p>
        Every element on a web page is a block or a rectangle of pixels. Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are some of the tools you can use in CSS to move these blocks exactly where you want them to go (instead of being one big list of elements).

      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.

      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
