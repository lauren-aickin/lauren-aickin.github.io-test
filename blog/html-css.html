    <h1>Relative, Absolute and Fixed positioning in CSS</h1>
    <h2>What are they and how do they <em>differ?</em></h2>

    <p>
        Every element on a web page is a block or a rectangle of pixels. Relative, absolute and fixed positioning are some of the tools you can use in CSS to move these blocks exactly where you want them to go (instead of having one big list of elements like the below).
        <img src=/images/Document-flow-blocks.png alt="document block layout">
        This initial positioning is called "static" and is the default for every element.
      </p>
    <p>
      Relative positioning is a way to move your blocks (or elements) in context to themselves. IE the movement commands you use in conjunction with relative positioning will operate relative to where the block would normally be.
