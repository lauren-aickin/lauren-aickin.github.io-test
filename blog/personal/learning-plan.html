    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>09 September 2021</h3>
    
    <p>
        <strong>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>
        I want a good work/life balance - whether that's the ability to wfh or shift my working hours when possible.
        Even more than this I want to work in a field that I'm proud of and interested in. 
        I have interests in gaming, space (hello rocket lab), film, robotics/automation but I'd be happy doing anything that lets you get into the nitty gritty of how something works.
    </p>
    <p>     
        <strong>My strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong><br>
        <em>Strengths:</em><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Problem solving - I'll work at something until I get it - it's my favourite type of endorphin!</li>
        <li>Glass half full - I try to see the positive in every scenario even when it feels like everythings broken.</li>
        <li>Focus - when I get in a flow I'll just keep going with full focus.</li>
        <li>I love learning - it's insatiable and I always want to know how to do everything I can.</li>
        <li>I don't just want to know how to do something, I want to know the best way.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <em>Limitations:</em><br>
        <ul>
        <li>My love of solving problems will sometimes make me too independant - I can get stuck on a problem for hours because I want the satisfaction of solving it myself.</li>
        <li>Focus - I can get stuck in my focused state and become time blind - I'll work on something for hours when I should really take a break.</li>
        <li>If what I've made doesn't match my vision I can feel like my creation is a failure.</li>
        <li>Confidence - I always think about my limitations more than my achievements.</li> 
        <li>Sometimes I'll try to learn too much at once too fast.</li>
        <li>If there's too many environment inputs (certain visuals/sounds) and I'm already tired from masking, if something else happens (unexpected schedule changes is one I can struggle with) I can hit an asd overload and need to give myself time to recover/recharge. This can be tough when I just want to keep working.</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>  
    <p>  
        <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Collaboration and networking - I want more confidence talking to people I don't know and asking for help.</li>
        <li>I want to learn to back myself and stop selling myself short - I don't like to feel like I'm bragging and I'm not great at negotiating for myself/my skills.</li>
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>   
        <strong>My commandments to how I will manage my workload in this programme</strong><br>
        I will stay focused when working - asking for help when needed but also giving help to others when able.
    <br>  
        When things start to get to me I will take a break - whether it's to go for a walk outside, meditating somewhere quiet or to listen to music with noise cancelling. 
        I will ask for help if it's relevant to the situation or if I am overwhelmed for an extended period.
   <br>  
        I will set a time limit on myself when I hit a problem (is it a small line of code? set 15mins. Is it a large section to understand? set 60mins with a break midway).
        If I exceed my own time limit I will ask my peers to see if they've encountered the same roadblock/if they can help.
        Otherwise I will reach out to my facillitator/another facillitator if it's more complex and I need more detail.
    <br> 
        I expect the facilitation team to have compassion if something has really got me down/stuck and
        to call me out if they notice me spending too much time on something I shouldn't be.
    <br>   
        I don't have any fixed commitments but I like to take an exercise break during the day based on when I need time away from the screen.    </p>
