            <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <emphasis>I've always been a quick reader and learner when it comes to rule based learning.</emphasis> I need to accept that it's not always best to go fast and that things won't always come quickly/ </li>
                <li>
                    <emphasis>I always focus on how something I've made doesn't have something that another persons does.</emphasis> I need to know that it's not a competition/a race and focus on my own progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <emphasis>I am very self critical.</emphasis> I feel imposter syndrome a lot and doubt my own abilities. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
            <br>
            I think all of these are equally valuable. Understanding your own values/self/way of thinking makes it easier to pick up when your thinking might be biased/if you are judging unfairly. It also helps when planning your goals long term and what you need from a career to feel valued and competent. Empathy helps us understand what it's like for someone else to clean up our mess, and so helps us keep our work to a higher standard. On the flip side it also helps us when we come across messy code to take a step back and know that the person who wrote it didn't make it like that with ill intent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
            <br>
            The indepth learning of the brain! I wish neuroplasticity and emotional-intelligence were a bigger focus earlier in life. I think understanding that brains are not just set as is and are changeable helps both in practical learning and creating healthy habits.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
            <br>
            I didn't find the core learning challenging as such. I found it interesting and easy to understand!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong>
            <br>
            I think your core principals atrongly influence your ability to learn. They're important in interviews and in the workplace. They're becoming more and more a focus of employees as companies learn their importance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
            <br>
            Understanding your brain really does change the way you learn. It teaches you what brings up your walls and what opens your mind. While I can see how some people would rather spend the entire course programming in traditional boot camp style, having these core learnings is an integral part of why Dev Academy students do well and is much more sustainable.
