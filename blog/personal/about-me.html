        <li>Hi there!<br> My names Lauren and I'm a 26 year old aspiring code master.</li>
        <li>I've had a wild range of experience as I try to find the career path that fits me. After finishing high school I became a qualified commercial pilot with all sorts of fun ratings. Since then I've dabbled as: 
          <br>An Aviation security officer (scanning bags for guns/bombs etc);
          <br>A banker, managing home loans and investments;
          <br>An MPI officer (think border patrol);
          <br>And an Analyst, managing all kinds of data.</li>
        <li>After five or so years thinking about shifting into the tech field and using free learning resources I've finally taken the leap and have been enjoying every minute!</li>
