    <p>
      <strong>My core personal values.</strong><br>

      While reseraching my own core values this quote really resonated with me:<br>
      "This personality type is full of contradictions. Architects are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused."*<br>
      I love a challenge - every situation is an opportunity to learn which helps me stay motivated while problem solving.<br> 
      I don't like feeling like I'm not stretching my brain/capabilitys - I want to always be learning and improving.
    </p>
    <p>  
      <strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</strong><br>
      
      At the end of my training for a previous role, each cohort attends a very traditional graduation ceremony where they perform a waiata and haka before receiving their first stripe. These have both been written by and for the organisation with the focus on values/community/togetherness. Everyone practices these as a group for 2 hours a day for 3 months before the graduation so that every worker knows them by heart. Usually there will be one kaitataki (leader) but for our year they wanted two - one male and one female.<br>
      The two people initially selected were those with the strongest connection to their maori heritage - but after the selection the woman chosen approached me and told me that she has severe stage fright and couldn't think of anything she wanted to do less than take a leadership position (the grad ceremony is attended by over a 150 guests). She told me that she thought I looked the most confident in our practices and asked me to take over the leadership role.<br>
      I had to take a moment to consider for a few reasons:
      While my family has been in NZ for a few generations now my origins further than that are not - I wanted to make sure I showed respect to the tradition and was worried I might not do it justice.<br> 
      I had been told already that my haka leans towards the masculine rather than feminine style which is not always OK.<br>
      I talked to the lady who had asked me to take the role over and was very open about my concerns. Together we sat down with the Maori who had created this specific haka to ask them for their thoughts - with the caveat that even with this I would only agree if she would help mentor me in the role to show it proper respect.<br>
      I ended up gaining their approval and with their coaching was able to proudly lead our cohort of 50 during our graduation - something I'm still thankful for and that made me feel a much stronger connection with NZ culture.
    </p>
    <p> 
       <strong>How has my culture influenced my values and ideas?</strong><br>
      
      Kiwi culture is to me very emotionally closed off - toughen up and get it done, don't complain or ask for more. I think this has impacted me in that I still find it difficult to stick up for myself, whether thats for a pay rise or to push my ideas.<br>
      But while I appreciate and feel more connected to NZ heritage and culture as an adult, as a teen I felt very disconnected - with all my ancestral roots being Scottish/Irish/English I felt both like not a true New Zealander but also too many generations away from my ancestor origins to feel connected to their cultures: and so I was much more influenced by my parents growing up.<br>
      My father is super introverted and an intellectual perfectionist in both work and general life - but fairly closed off emotionally. My mother is the complete opposite - extroverted to the max and emotionally tuned/focused 100% on people and caring for them.<br>
      I think both sides have had their impacts on me and while my base personality traits seem to follow closer to my fathers, the influence of my mother really helped me appreciate people and being emotionally open.  
    </p>
    <p>   
      <strong>My base strengths and limitations.</strong><br>
      
      <em>Strengths:</em><br>
      <ul> 
      <li>Independance, I don't mind working alone.</li>
      <li>Determination, "Whenever an idea or pursuit captures their imagination, Architects dedicate themselves to mastering the subject and gaining relevant skills."*</li>
      <li>Logical/Methodical, love for details and the aim for perfection.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      
      <em>Limitations:</em><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Super introverted (90% on the Myers Briggs). Tendancy to not like starting conversations with people I don't know which can hinder networking.</li>
      <li>"Architects derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity"* which can make me take it hard when I struggle with a task/feel like I'm not understanding something.</ul>
      <li>The aim for perfection can also limit me - sometimes things don't need to be perfect. It can slow down my decisions.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Which of my strengths will help in my learning journey?</strong>
      <br>
      My focus on learning will help keep me determined to do my best - obstacles may make me lose confidence if I'm stuck for longer than I expect/if I can't find my perfect answer but the thrill of solving the problem will keep me motivated. 
    </p>

      <strong>An example from my experience of where I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</strong>
      <br>
      During work as an Analyst I was responsible for pulling together information from multiple different teams/areas to create a weekly report for upper management. The info had to be provided fairly quickly to be able to get the report through various review processes before the Friday deadline. Most teams were responsive and handed their info in quickly but one team "Echo" was super resistant/slow to respond and consistently extremely late. I then heard that Echo was very under the pump/had a big workload with other reporting/multiple deadlines all coinciding.<br>
      Based on this I made some changes:<br>
      I looked into the other reporting and found that there were multiple double ups in the info required from Echo - but in a completley different format which meant they had twice the workload for no reason. <br>
      I discussed this with my manager and we came to an agreement on taking out any repeated sections - the remaining info was then of a size that we could push the reporting out to monthly.<br>
      While talking these changes through with Echo they brought up that with everything else going on they were also finding it hard to keep track of each reports deadlines. Because of this I implemented extra reminders for them (one a week early so they could gather a draft on info and another 2 days before due so that they could finalise the initial draft).<br>
      These changes made a huge difference for their communication/reliability - if I were to run into this again I would try to organise a solution quicker once I noticed the pattern forming, I think even having their problems be heard and aknowledged helped the relationship hugely.
