    <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>09 September 2021</h3>
    
    <p>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?<br>
        I want a good work/life balance - whether that's the ability to wfh or shift my working hours (eg. 4 x 10 hour days for 3 days off).
        Even more than this I want to work in a field that I'm proud of and interested in. 
        I have interests in gaming, space (hello rocket lab), film, robotics/ automation but I'd be happy doing anything that lets you get into the nitty gritty of how something works.
    </p>
    <p>     
        A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning<br>
        Strengths:<br>
        Problem solving - I'll work at something until I get it - it's my favourite type of endorphin!
        Glass half full - I try to see the positive in every scenario even when it feels like everythings broken.
        Focus - when I get in a flow I'll just keep going with full focus.
        I love learning - it's insatiable and I always want to know how to do everything I can.
        I don't just want to know how to do something, I want to know the best way.
    </p>
    <p>  
        Limitations:<br>
        My love of solving problems will sometimes make me too independant - I can get stuck on a problem for hours because I want the satisfaction of solving it myself.
        Focus - I can get stuck in my focused state and become time blind - I'll work on something for hours when I should really take a break.
        If what I've made doesn't match my vision I can feel like my creation is a failure.
        Confidence - I always think about my limitations more than my achievements. 
        Sometimes I'll try to learn too much at once too fast.
        Sometimes if there's already too many environment inputs (visual/sound) and I'm already tired from masking, if something else small happens (unexpected schedule changes) I can hit an asd overload. 
    </p>  
    <p>  
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br>
        Collaboration and networking - I want more confidence talking to people I don't know and asking for help.
        Stop selling myself short/interview skills - I don't like to feel like I'm bragging and I'm not good at negotiating for myself/my skills. 
    </p>
    <p>   
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
        Stay focused when working - ask for help when needed but also give help to others when able.
    </p>
    <p>    
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br>
        Take a break - go for a walk outside somewhere quiet/meditate/listen to music with noise cancelling. 
        Ask for help if it's relevant to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>   
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br>
        Set a time limit on myself when I hit a problem (is it a small line of code? set 15mins. Is it a large section to understand? set 60mins with a break midway)
        Ask my peers initially - see if they've encountered the same roadblock/if they can help.
        Reach out to my facillitator/another facillitator if the above doesn't work, it's more complex and I need more detail.
    </p>
    <p>    
        A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br>
        Compassion if something has really got me down/stuck.
        Call me out if you notice me spending too much time on something I shouldn't be.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br>
        These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.
        I don't have any fixed commitments (I like to take an exercise break during the day but the timing is flexible.)
