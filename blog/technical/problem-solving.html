    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <h3>22 September 2021</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Problem solving techniques</strong><br>
      There are endless ways to problem solve but there are a few common techniques in particular that many coders find useful.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Pseudocode</emphasis><br>
      Pseudocode is writing out the steps you need to take in your planned code in plain language. It can be writted in the way you feel fits you best but is often structured in the same conventions as the coding language you're using. This helps you convert it to your actual code quicker and work at a problem one solution at a time. I find this most useful for breaking down more complicated goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Rubber ducky</emphasis><br>
      The rubber ducky method is a popular debugging tactic that has been used in programming for a considerable amount of time. The name itself is a reference to a book from 1999 titled 'the Pragmatic Programmer'. The author describes a programmer that carrys a rubber duck and debugs their code by explaining it line by line to said duck. In reality anything can be your duck - a colleague, a family member or a friend, as long as you're explaining your code as though you're talking to someone who's never seen your project before. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Error Message Deciphering</emphasis><br>
      This one is just how it sounds - delving into your codes error messages and reading them properly. Sometimes the error message will even tell you what line it's finding an error in! This is most useful for syntax errors and can be especially useful when used in conjunction with <emphasis>console.logging</emphasis> to get a full behind the scenes picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Google</emphasis><br>
      You're likely already very familiar with having a solid google when you have questions to answer. The great thing about coding problems is that if you're coming across a confusing issue then someone else probably already has too! There's unimaginable levels of resources online and if you phrase your question a few different ways you'll almost always find multiple detailed solutions or tutorials. Otherwise <emphasis>ask for help!</emphasis> You can always ask your question on a popular coding site/blog or reach out to your peers/coaches.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <p>
      I dabble a little in all of these techniques but my first instinct is always google (my personal fave). I recently used my partner as a pseudo rubber duck for a kata challenge and it helped immediately! Sometimes going back to your original goals is so important, in that instance I had lost sight of my original requirements and had skipped some important steps. That ah-ha! moment is always worth it in the end even if you cant believe you spent so long over something like a missing semi-colon. Have a bit of a go at different problem solving methods next time you hit a road-bump and see if there's any that would fit in your toolkit.
