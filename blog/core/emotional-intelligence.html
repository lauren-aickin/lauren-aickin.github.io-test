    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>13 September 2021</h3>
    
    <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to perceive, manage, and regulate emotions in positive ways.<br>
        It is different from Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in that:<br>
        IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. It helps with visual processing, working memory and fluid & quantitative reasoning.<br> 
        While EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions. This helps with identifying emotions, relating to others and social communication.<br><br>
        IQ is a very narrow depiction of human intelligence - it is argued by some (such as Psychologist Howard Gardner) that there is instead, multiple intelligences and that people have strengths and weaknesses in a number of areas.<br>
        EQ can be used to defuse conflicts, turn intention into action and make informed decisions that relate to your own values.
        It's highly valued in employees and just helps you be an all round better human. If you feel that you have a low EQ, studies show that this is both teachable and is able to be strengthened through practice. Luckily there's many learning resources online, as easy as a google search away!
