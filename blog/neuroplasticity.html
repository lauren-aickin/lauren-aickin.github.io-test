<h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth</h2>
<h3>20 September 2021</h3>
  <span>Neuroplasticity</span>
  <p>
    <emphasis>Knowledge is power.</emphasis><br>
    “Neuroplasticity” refers to your brain’s ability to restructure or rewire itself when it recognizes the need for adaption. In other words, it can continue developing and changing throughout life. This can be positive or negative - every little choice makes a difference to your brain - so how can you use this knowledge?<br>
    Challenge yourself - try learning something new even if it's small each day. This can be studying a new language/instrument or painting/reading/playing a challenging video game.<br>
    Get plenty of sleep! Sleep is an important part of both physical and mental health but it also plays a big part in growth in the brain.<br>
    Theres's plenty of ways to use the superpower of knowing you can change your brain - go do some research until you feel like you could convince a friend of its power.<br>

<span>Fixed vs Growth mindset</span><br>
<p>
    Understanding is believing and belief in yourself and your potential is a truely powerful thing.<br>
    <br>
    Fixed and growth mindsets are just what they sound like on the tin. A fixed mindset is believing your abilities and skills are a set value - some people are talented and others are not. A growth mindset is believing you can change and improve yoiur abilities and skills - as long as you work on them. Often those with a fixed mindset will be always striving to prove what they're good at - "how can I look smart/capable?"
    The growth mindset on the other hand creates a passion and hunger for learning instead of approval.   
</p>
<p>
    An important point to remember is that you can have a mixture of growth and fixed mindsets depending on the situation.<br>
    Think of something you're good at, maybe a favourite hobby/sport.<br>
    How open are you to improving that hobby/skill and how focused are you when you're practising it? - you probably feel inspired to learn and positive that you can achieve your goals, a real growth mindset.<br>
    Now think of something you feel terrible at - maybe a subject at school that you struggled with - like math. It's likely that you feel like your brain just isn't wired to do well in that subject, that even if you practise you wont do as well as others so to focus on other topics - a fixed mindset.<br>
    Now I'm not telling you to go force yourself to learn something you have no interest in but if there's something you want to learn but haven't tried because you don't feel smart enough/like you can do it - you can do it! Find a learning style that suits you and use the power of knowing your brain has neuroplasticity to create a growth mindset.<br>
